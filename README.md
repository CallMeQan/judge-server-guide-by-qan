# Custom DMOJ Online Judge Development Documentation

Develop a server based on [DMOJ's Online Judge](https://github.com/DMOJ/online-judge) and communicate with [DMOJ's Judge Server](https://github.com/DMOJ/judge-server)

## Please have a look on example [`server.py`](./examples/server/server.py)

Server must [handle incoming packet](./docs/server/README.md) and [send packet to judge](./docs/judge/README.md)
